Machine Learning AI Project

This project uses images of a cat named Tiny, and images of other cats to train a Supervised Image Classification AI to identify whether a picture fed into it is of "Tiny" or of another cat.

This project was used as a starter/introduction into Machine Learning AI. A report is included discussing techniques used and final results

Please do not pass this project off as your own, especially when it comes to academic work
